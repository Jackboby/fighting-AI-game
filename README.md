# fighting-AI-game
This is a fighting game I made where you have to battle an AI, the controls are just arrow key’s to move and A to attack. Also, there’s no feedback of if your hurting the other player or not.

also, to move fast, you have to spam the arrow keys.
and, for jumping; it's the up arrow key, not space bar.

if you would want to mod the game, check out `console.js`

here's a working version: https://fight-the-ai.jacktoons.repl.co
